# Predicting RNAcompete binding from RNA bind-n-seq data
**Introduction**
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a significant role in various cellular processes, including mRNA splicing, transport, stability, and translation, making them essential for proper cellular functioning. Deciphering the RNA-binding preferences of RBPs is crucial for understanding the intricate regulatory networks that govern cellular processes at the molecular level. For measuring RNA binding preferences, we used data from two different technologies: RNA Bind-n-Seq and RNAcompete. For each RBP we implemented a deep learning model and use it to score RNAcompete probes to find the RNA binding preferences. In this project we aim to assign binding intensities to RNAcompete probes. We achieved this by implement an aggregation function over the
model probability to produce a single binding score.

**Model architecture:**

We developed a model to predict the RNA binding preferences from RNA bind-n-seq data. Our model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) comprised of 1D-convolution layer with 128 convolutional kernels (width 6, stride 1), a max pooling layer (pool size 2, stride 2), a fully connected layer with 64 nodes (ReLU activation), and an output layer with 4 nodes (softmax activation).  The input is a one-hot encoding of size of the maximum sequence length of RNAcompete or RNA Bind-n-Seq sequences. The labels are corresponded to the different concentrations. The input file was labeled as 0, concentrations that smaller than 100nM ware labeled as 1, concentrations between 100nM and 500nM were labeled as 2 and concentrations above 500nM was labeled as 3. Model parameters were learned by Adam optimizer, employing a learning rate decay of approximately 0.009. This decay was executed at intervals of 5000 steps, with a decay rate of 0.9. For the optimization process, the categorical cross-entropy loss function was employed.
